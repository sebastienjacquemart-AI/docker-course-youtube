## What is Docker?

### What is a container
A way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configurations: portable, easily shared and moved around.
Thus, makes development and deployment very easy.

### Where do containers live?
In a container repository (public/private)

### How do containers improve the development process?
- Before containers: every developer installs dependencies on local environment (different on each OS) (= dependency version conflicts); Many different steps where something could go wrong.
- After containers: dependencies are not installed directly on OS, because container is its own isolated environment packaged with needed configuration (no configuration needed); One step to fetch and start the container.

### How can containers improve the deployment process?
- Before containers: developers produces artifacts with instructions to install the artifact on the server and hands them over to operations (to deploy application); Dependency version conflicts + misunderstanding between development and operations.
- After containers: developers and operations work together to package the application in a container; One step to pull and run container image.
